## Hi everyone, I'm Alexander PotapovðŸ‘‹

I'm into web-fullstack development! But I also like game-development.

### ðŸ”­ Skills

My favorite programming language is **Java** and **JS**, but I also have skills in:
- **Python**, also for data science with **Jupyter Notebook**
- **C#**

Also I have some other skills:
- **Vue3**
- **SQL** (Oracle, MySql and a bit of PostgreSQL)
- **NoSQL** (MongoDB)
- **Git**
- a bit **React.js**

### ðŸŒ± Education

I graduated from Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University with a bachelor's degree in 2022! And now I am studying there in the magistracy, which I will graduate in 2024. My bachelor's thesis is **Development of artificial intelligence for coordinating game objects of the game genre Tower Defense**. It was dedicated to the development of game AI for coordinating waves of opponents, based on the location of the towers by the player.
