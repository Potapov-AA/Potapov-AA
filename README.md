My favorite programming language is **Python**, but I also have skills in:

I enjoy building game with **Unity** and **Godot**!

### ðŸŒ± Education

I graduated from Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University with a bachelor's degree in 2022! And now I am studying there in the magistracy, which I will graduate in 2024. My bachelor's thesis is **Development of artificial intelligence for coordinating game objects of the game genre Tower Defense**. It was dedicated to the development of game AI for coordinating waves of opponents, based on the location of the towers by the player.
