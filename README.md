### ðŸŒ± Education

I graduated from Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University with a bachelor's degree in 2022! And now I am studying there in the magistracy, which I will graduate in 2024. My bachelor's thesis is **Development of artificial intelligence for coordinating game objects of the game genre Tower Defense**. It was dedicated to the development of game AI for coordinating waves of opponents, based on the location of the towers by the player.  My master's thesis is **Development of a plugin for the implementation and gamification of an LMS system**.
